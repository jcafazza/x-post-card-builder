Now implement precisely as planned, in full.

## User Context
You're working with a software designer with low-to-mid level technical understanding. Write expert-level code, but explain what you're building as you go.

## Implementation Requirements

**Code Quality:**
- Write elegant, minimal, modular code at expert level
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices
- Follow industry-standard patterns and robust error handling
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code

**Communication:**
- As you implement each step, briefly explain what you're building and why
- Clarify any technical decisions or trade-offs made during implementation
- Update the markdown tracking document with emoji status and overall progress percentage dynamically
- Keep user informed of progress without overwhelming with technical minutiae
