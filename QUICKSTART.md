# Quickstart

Get the X Post Card Builder running locally, then deploy it to Vercel.

## Local (2 minutes)

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploy to Vercel

- Import the repo into Vercel as a **Next.js** project
- Set the **Root Directory** to `web`
- Deploy

That’s it — the UI and API routes (`/api/scrape-post`, `/api/image`) ship together.
